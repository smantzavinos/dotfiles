# üß™ Testing & Validation Strategy

## Agent Creation Testing

**MCD Completeness Validation**:
```bash
# Check section presence
grep -c "^# üéØ\|^# üèóÔ∏è\|^# üìã\|^# üìÅ\|^# ‚úÖ\|^# üîó\|^# üß™\|^# üöÄ" agent-file.md

# Verify minimum content length per section
awk '/^# üéØ/{flag=1; count=0; next} /^# üèóÔ∏è/{if(flag && count<10) print "Overview section too short"; flag=0}' agent-file.md

# Check for code examples
grep -c '```' agent-file.md
```

**YAML Frontmatter Validation**:
```bash
# Extract and validate YAML
head -n 20 agent-file.md | grep -A 20 "^---$" | head -n -1 | tail -n +2 > temp.yaml
python -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('temp.yaml'))" && echo "Valid YAML" || echo "Invalid YAML"

# Check required fields
grep -q "description:" temp.yaml && echo "Description present" || echo "Missing description"
grep -q "mode:" temp.yaml && echo "Mode present" || echo "Missing mode"
```

**Content Quality Validation**:
```bash
# Check for placeholder text
grep -i "TODO\|FIXME\|PLACEHOLDER\|\[.*\]" agent-file.md

# Verify code block syntax
grep -n '```' agent-file.md | while read line; do
  echo "Code block at: $line"
done

# Check for specific examples vs generic text
grep -c "example\|specific\|concrete" agent-file.md
```

## Agent Functionality Testing

**Basic Invocation Testing**:
```bash
# Test agent file can be read
test -r .opencode/agent/agent-name.md && echo "Agent file accessible"

# Validate file size (should be substantial)
wc -l .opencode/agent/agent-name.md | awk '{if($1 > 500) print "Comprehensive agent"; else print "Agent may be incomplete"}'
```

**Permission Validation**:
```yaml
# Test permission structure
permissions:
  edit: allow
  bash:
    "safe-command*": allow
    "risky-command*": ask
    "*": ask
```

**Integration Testing**:
```bash
# Test with OpenCode (if available)
# opencode agent list | grep agent-name

# Validate markdown structure
markdown-lint .opencode/agent/agent-name.md

# Check for broken links
grep -o 'http[s]*://[^)]*' agent-file.md | while read url; do
  curl -s --head "$url" | head -n 1
done
```

# Validate YAML frontmatter
head -n 30 .opencode/agent/[agent-name].md | python -c "
import sys, yaml
content = sys.stdin.read()
try:
    yaml.safe_load(content.split('---')[1])
    print('Valid YAML')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'YAML Error: {e}')
"
```

**Permission Denied Errors**:
